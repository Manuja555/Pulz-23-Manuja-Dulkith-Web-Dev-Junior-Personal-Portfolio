## Project Overview
This website is a Personal Portfolio made for my self and the website is built entirely from light colours giving it a light theme by default. The Colour scheme used is White, Blue & Purple. This website is made in approzimately 6 hours and only have the back end due to lack of time and lack of backend features that can be added to a portfolio website.

## Technologies Used
I only used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for this Project

## Steps to setup the code in a local environment
Since the code only have the front-end functionalities we can easily setup it when compared to a web app with server side scripting.
First Download a prefered text editor or else you can use Windows Notepad.(I recommend Visual Studio Code)
Then open the index.html file in VS Code. or if you have some other ediotr you can directly open it in your browser without going into the code ediotr.
In case you have VS Code. I recommened you to go download Live Server Add on and right click on the worspace and click open with Live server.
And there you go! You have succssfully setuped the website in a local environment

## Future Plan
I have some plans to add back end functionality to this app and add some more visual effects as well.
